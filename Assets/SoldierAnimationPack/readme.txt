Soldier Animation Pack Notes
Last Updated 2013-07-12 by Kristopher Peterson (kristopher.patrick.peterson@gmail.com)

Hey, first off thanks for purchasing and using this pack!  

This pack was authored in Unity 3.5 so if you are using Unity4x you will get a prompt when importing the textures to 'fix' by converting to normal map, and you'll want to choose to ignore that.  The 'Import Type' should be left at 'Default'.

The following animations are meant to be played on the upper body only so that they can be blended with the movement animations, and will not contain any animation for anything above the B_Spine node:

Fire
Reload
Pain
Throw Grenade
Use Ability
Use Item
Signal
